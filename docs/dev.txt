Contributing to the project
###########################

This document provides guidelines for people who want to contribute to the
project.


**************
Create tickets
**************

Please use the `bugtracker`_ **before** starting some work:

* check if the bug or feature request has already been filed. It may have been
  answered too!

* else create a new ticket.

* if you plan to contribute, tell us, so that we are given an opportunity to
  give feedback as soon as possible.

* Then, in your commit messages, reference the ticket with some
  ``refs #TICKET-ID`` syntax.


***************
Fork and branch
***************

* Work in forks and branches.

* Prefix your branch with the ticket ID corresponding to the issue. As an
  example, if you are working on ticket #23 which is about contribute
  documentation, name your branch like ``23-contribute-doc``.

* If you work in a development branch and want to refresh it with changes from
  master, please `rebase`_ or `merge-based rebase`_, i.e. don't merge master.


*******************************
Setup a development environment
*******************************

System requirements:

* `Python`_ version 2.7 or 3.3, available as ``python`` command.
  
  .. note::

     You may use `Virtualenv`_ to make sure the active ``python`` is the right
     one.

* make and wget to use the provided :file:`Makefile`.

Execute:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone git@github.com:peopledoc/django-chartjs.git
   cd django-chartjs/
   make test

If you cannot execute the Makefile, read it and adapt the few commands it
contains to your needs.


************
The Makefile
************

A :file:`Makefile` is provided to ease development. Use it to:

* setup the development environment: ``make develop``
* update it, as an example, after a pull: ``make update``
* run tests: ``make test``
* build documentation: ``make documentation``

The :file:`Makefile` is intended to be a live reference for the development
environment.


*************
Documentation
*************

Follow `style guide for Sphinx-based documentations`_ when editing the
documentation.


**************
Test and build
**************

Use `the Makefile`_.


*********************

documentation.
